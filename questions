Backgroud introduction: Hi ***, I am Huifan and just join CITI for a month. I am a NLP software engineer from ICG Taxt Analytics team, which focusing on providing automatic text analytics services and solutions to support various kinds of business in Citi using machine learning technics. For exmaple, we already have provided email inquiry soluition for custody business to auto track the trade status and do field extraction for SWIFT. 

Q1: Since we already have a good start with the custody domain, can I ask if we have any strategy/future plan to apply NLP/ML technics to other domains so that we can use our current experience gained from custody and help such domain to improve their efficiency?   

Q2: I have heared that CITI encourages innovation in banking industry. Can I ask what our strategy/process is to create innovation? Is there any major difference between the way we incubate new idea than ther other company?

Q3: I notice most of our projects are Co-operative projects that requires the cooperation from several global teams. It is a good opportunity for us to work with the people around the world. From management perspective, what is the benefit of running projects globally?
